    "question": "A researcher selected 2 random samples of employees in a large company to estimate the percentage of employees that planned to vote in favor of a new division. Based on the first sample, the researcher estimated that \(68\%\) of the employees would vote in favor, with an associated margin of error of \(9.7\%\). Based on the second sample, the researcher estimated that \(84\%\) of the employees would vote in favor, with an associated margin of error of \(6.7\%\). Assuming the margins of error were calculated in the same way, which of the following best explains why the second sample obtained a smaller margin of error than the first sample?",
